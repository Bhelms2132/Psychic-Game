# Psychic-Game

This project is using a mix of html, css and javascript. Some elements of javascript used in making this project are array, .onkeyup function,
conditionls ie. if/else statements, console.log (tool helpfull for seeing if a certain code is working properly).


## How Psychic-Game works

There are nine leters hard coded in an array for the game to choose from.   The user has five attempts to choose the correct letter, mean while it will let the user know exactly how many trys the user has left.   If the user chooses correctly, the game will score a win in the win column.  If the user guess incorrectly all five times, the game will score a lose in the losses column.  The game will keep track of total wins and losses for the user.
