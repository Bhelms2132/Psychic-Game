# Psychic-Game



## How Psychic-Game works

There are nine leters hard coded in an array for the game to choose from. The game will pick one letter from the nine to compare the users guesse with.  The user has five attempts to choose the correct letter, mean while it will let the user know exactly how many trys the user has left.   If the user chooses correctly, the game will score a win in the win column.  If the user guess incorrectly all five times, the game will score a lose in the losses column.  The game will keep track of total wins and losses for the user.

## Game Played
Here is an image of a game played.  Notice how it keeps track of the users current wins, losses, remaining picks and the choices that have been selected so the user dosen't chose the same letter twice.
